			<h2><span>FAQs</span></h2>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3>What exactly is happening on July 1?</h3>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>The interest rate charged on subsidized Stafford loans is doubling, from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3>What's a Stafford loan?</h3>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>It's a kind of loan product the federal government offers students to help pay for the costs of going to college.</p>
					<p>There are two types:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Subsidized Stafford loans:</strong> only available to students with financial need (that is, students for whom the <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/glossary#Cost_of_Attendance_COA">cost of attendance</a> exceeds what their family can pay). The government pays the interest on the loans for as long as they're in school.</li>
						<li><strong>Unsubsidized Stafford loans:</strong> aren't limited to low-income students, and students pay the interest on them while they are in school.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3>What other loans does the government offer?</h3>
				<div class="answer">
					<strong>PLUS loans:</strong> are available for graduate students to help pay for the cost of graduate studies, and for parents of undergraduates to help pay for the costs of college.
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3>Didn't we eliminate the interest rate increase last year?</h3>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>In 2012, President Obama worked with Congress to pass a one-year extension of the 3.4% interest rate &mdash; but it only extended the rate for a year, so it's due to expire again in a couple weeks. The President put forward a long-term solution in his FY2014 budget request, which would keep the rate from doubling, get the best interest rate for students and families today, and protect borrowers from unmanageable amounts of student debt. Now, we need Congress to act to prevent rates from rising on July 1.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3>Which students will this affect?</h3>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>If Congress does not act, borrowers who take out a subsidized Stafford loan after July 1, 2013 will see their rates double to 6.8%.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3>What are Republicans doing about it?</h3>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>House Republicans have passed legislation that would address student loan interest rates in the long term. Unfortunately, it had the wrong approach: it would not guarantee low rates for today's students by letting rates vary after the loan has already been taken out; it would impose the largest interest rate increases on low- and middle-income students; and it would use higher interest rates on students to pay down the deficit. The Administration does not support this proposal.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3>And Obama?</h3>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>The President's plan provides a long-term solution on interest rates that is fair, fiscally-responsible, and benefits more borrowers by offering lower interest rates on all federal student loans.</p>
					<p>Under the President's plan you would see the rate on need-based Subsidized Stafford loans fall to a low 2.9% over the life of the loan for students taking out a loan next year.</p>
					<p>The President's plan is budget neutral and maintains that all of the investments in the loan program are directed toward student benefits &mdash; rather than toward deficit reduction funded on the backs of students.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3>So, whose plan is the best for students?</h3>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>What's most important for America's students and families is that rates don't double on July 1 and that we keep the cost of college attainable. While the President continues to advocate for the plan he put forward in his budget proposal, the Administration will continue working with Congress on a solution that will keep rates low for students before the July 1 deadline.</p>
