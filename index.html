			<h2><span>FAQs</span></h2>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3>Is the President actually texting me back?</h3>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>Yes. Young people across the country are sending in their questions about student debt. DoSomething.org is selecting one question per day to be answered and sending it to President Obama. President Obama is then sending out the question and his response to everyone signed up. Due to the high volume of messages, the President cannot read every incoming message.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3>How do I text the President?</h3>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>Text PREZ to 38383. You will receive a confirmation message explaining on how to send and receive texts from President Obama.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3>Does this experience cost me money?</h3>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>Normal message and data rates apply. There are no additional costs. E.g. texting with the President costs the same as texting with friends and family.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3>Why is there so much attention being put on student loans and student interest rates right now?</h3>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>The interest rate charged on subsidized Stafford loans is doubling, from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3>What's a Stafford loan?</h3>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>It's a kind of loan product the federal government offers students to help pay for the costs of going to college.</p>
					<p>There are two types:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Subsidized Stafford loans:</strong> only available to students with financial need (that is, students for whom the <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/glossary#Cost_of_Attendance_COA">cost of attendance</a> exceeds what their family can pay). The government pays the interest on the loans for as long as they're in school.</li>
						<li><strong>Unsubsidized Stafford loans:</strong> aren't limited to low-income students, and students pay the interest on them while they are in school.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3>What other loans does the government offer?</h3>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>The Department of Education’s Federal Student Aid office offers a variety of grant and loan options to help students and families pay for the cost of college. In addition to the Stafford loans described above, many families take advantage of PLUS loans, which are available for graduate students to help pay for the cost of graduate studies, and for parents of undergraduates to help pay for the costs of college.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3>Didn't we eliminate the interest rate increase last year?</h3>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>In 2012, President Obama worked with Congress to pass an extension of the 3.4% interest rate – but it only extended the rate for a year, so it’s due to expire again in a couple weeks. The President proposed a solution in his FY2014 budget request, which would keep the rate from doubling, provides the lowest proposed interest rate for students and families today, and minimize the increase in student debt. Congress needs to agree on a solution to prevent rates from doubling on July 1.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3>Which students will this affect?</h3>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>If an agreement is not reached, borrowers who take out a subsidized Stafford loan on or after July 1, 2013 will see their rates double to 6.8%.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3>What are the two proposals to solve the issue?</h3>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>House Republicans have passed legislation that would address student loan interest rates in the long term. This plan would let rates vary with the market after the loan has been taken out. This plan would use interest rates on students to pay down the deficit. The Administration does not support this proposal.</p>
					<p>The President put forward a long-term solution, which would keep the rate from doubling, get the best interest rate for students and families today, and protect borrowers from unmanageable amounts of student debt.</p>
					<p>The President’s plan is budget neutral and maintains all of the investments in the loan program are directed toward student benefits – rather than toward deficit reduction.</p>
					<p>Under the President's plan you see the rate on need-based Subsidized Stafford loans fall to a low 2.9% over the life of the loan for students taking out a loan next year.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3>So, will interest rates double?</h3>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>What's most important for America's students and families is that rates don't double on July 1 and that we keep the cost of college attainable. While the President continues to advocate for the plan he put forward in his budget proposal, the Administration will continue working with Congress on a solution that will keep rates low for students before the July 1 deadline.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3>What is the difference between a fixed interest rate and a variable interest rate?</h3>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>A student loan with a fixed interest rate has a set rate that will not fluctuate over time. A student loan with a variable interest rate has a rate that moves (up or down) based on the changes of an underlying index (note: some variable rate student loans come with an interest cap, which cannot be exceeded).</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3>Why is there a delay between messages?</h3>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>Due to the high volume of messages sent to President Obama, there is currently a backlog of messages. We are working to improve speeds. Everyone who joins the experience will receive every message that goes out after they have signed up, if on a delay. We apologize for any confusion.</p>
